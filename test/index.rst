   These classical Maxwell equations are written with unicode and converted by ``unicode-math`` for LaTex and 
   by ``mathjax`` for HTML.

   .. math::

       ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t   \\
       ∇ × H = J+ ∂D/∂t \\
       ∇ · D = ρ        \\
       ∇ · B = 0        \\
       D = εE           \\
       B = μH          


.. environment:: instruction
   :name: Instruction
   :html_title: title used by html builder
   :latex_title: title used by latex builder

   You can also use `:title:` if both `:html_title:` and `:latex_title:` should to be the same.  
   Replace ``instruction``. It is a mandatory argument. In latex you must have ``newtheorem{instruction}{Instruction}``,
   unless it is an available LaTeX environment, like ``equation``.

.. align:: center

   align is center

.. align:: left

   align is left

.. align:: flushleft

   align is flushleft

.. align:: right

   align is right

.. align:: flushright

   align is flushright

.. textcolor:: #00FF00

   This text is green

Some text here is different: :textcolor:`<#FF0000> this text is red` and this is not.


For refs use the normal sphinx refs like: see `theorem1`_.

In HTML one needs to provide formating via ``css``::
This can be done using ``conf.py``. See `conf.py`_.
